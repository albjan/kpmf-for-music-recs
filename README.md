## Kernelizing Probabilistic Matrix Factorization to Enhance Music Recommendation

# Probabilistic Models (STCS 6701) Final Project

We apply **kernelized probabilistic matrix factorization** (KPMF) to model the rating a user assigns a music artist in the `hetrec2011-lastfm-2k` dataset. This work has applications in music recommendation systems, which can rank artists by rating and then recommend the top ones.
